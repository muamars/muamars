# Hi there, I'm Muammar👋
![Profile views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=vincentdev&color=gray&style=flat) | [![wakatime](https://wakatime.com/badge/user/f0cd5a46-a8d6-4a46-9466-039a3277d334.svg)](https://wakatime.com/@f0cd5a46-a8d6-4a46-9466-039a3277d334)

I'm a **collaborative Frontend Developer** with strong foundations in **UI/UX**, and currently on the journey toward becoming a **Full-Stack Engineer** 🚀

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Vue, Next.js, Nuxt, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap  
- **Backend:** Laravel, .NET (in progress)  
- **Design & Tools:** Figma, Git, PostgreSQL  
- **DevOps:** Linux server management  

## 🛠️ Projects I've Worked On
- 🌱 **Environmental Licensing Systems** – used by government institutions to manage and approve permits
- 🏢 **Company Profile Platforms** – built for BUMN, private sector, and local government
- 📝 **CBT (Computer-Based Test) Applications** – for online assessments and training
- 🔧 **Oil Recommendation System** – helps users find the right oil for their vehicles
- 💸 **Financing System** – supports digital credit application and approval workflows
- 🧾 **Point of Sale (POS) System** – complete with inventory sync and multi-outlet support
- 📶 **Queue Management System** – designed for public services and clinics
- 📦 **Warehouse Inventory System** – tracks stock, movement, and item location
- ...and more scalable web applications from MVPs to production-ready systems

I've had the chance to **lead teams** and also dive deep as a **hands-on developer** — both roles fuel my passion for building clean, maintainable, and impactful products.

## 💡 What I'm Up To
- Enhancing my backend skills to complete the fullstack puzzle  
- Exploring mobile development (already got the basics!)  
- Always open for **freelance**, **remote roles**, **mentorship**, or **collaborations**
